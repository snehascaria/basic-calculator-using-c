# basic-calculator-using-c
Let's go through a basic calculator implementation in C that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.It uses switch statements to handle the program.

FEATURES
Additon : Adds two numbers
Subtraction : Subtracts two numbers
Multiplicaton : Multiplies two numbers
Division : Divides two numbers and shows error when divided with zero

COMPONENTS
Input Handling: The program will prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator.
Operations: Based on the operator provided, the corresponding arithmetic operation will be performed.
Output: The result of the operation will be displayed to the user.

PROGRAM EXECUTION
Initialization: The program begins by declaring necessary variables.
User Interaction: It prompts the user for input through console messages.
Control Flow: The switch statement evaluates the operator and directs the flow to the appropriate case where the calculation occurs.
Result Display: After performing the calculation, the result is printed, and the program may prompt the user to perform another calculation or exit.

HOW TO COMPILE ND RUN THE PPROGRAM
Instal C Compiler. Open the terminal, by typing 'nano filename.c' you are able to type in the code. Clone the code and save the code using filename.c (any filename can be given; Eg: arthmetic.c). Save your code by pressing CRTL X and Y. Compile it by typing gcc filename.c (Eg: gcc arthmetic.c)
